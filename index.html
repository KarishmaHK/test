    <p style="background-color:blanchedalmond;">The stained glass windows of Chartres Cathedral are held to be one of the best-preserved and most complete set of medieval stained glass, notably celebrated for their colours, especially their cobalt blue.<br>
        They cover 2600 square metres in total and consist of 172 bays illustrating biblical scenes, the lives of the saints and scenes from the life of trade guilds of the period.<br>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(237, 137, 125); font-size:50px;"> <em>Why windows?</em> </h2>
    <p><B>Since the late 10th century all churches across Europe had been built in a common Romanesque style, with thick walls supported by massive external buttresses and often with barrel vaulted naves.</B><br>
        This limited the number of windows, leading to a play of light and shade which builders compensated for by adding internal frescoes in bright colours.<br>
        In northern France buildings in this style would still be quite dark, with semi-circular arches not allowing large windows.

    The Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats.
    The Avengers are depicted as operating in the state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently from the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York.
    <br>
    The concept of the Avengers was teased in the post-credits scene of Iron Man (2008), the first MCU film, by Nick Fury as an initiative planned by him. The concept was further explored in Iron Man 2 (2010), with the introduction of Natasha Romanoff. The team was eventually established in the crossover-style film The Avengers (2012), which, followed by Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), established a series of four films that headlined the MCU and became the sixth highest-grossing film series of all time, with the MCU franchise overall ranking first. Arranged as an ensemble of core MCU characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, they are central to the MCU's Infinity Saga and have been acclaimed as an important part of the franchise.
    The Avengers are set to return in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Avengers: Secret Wars, both releasing in 2025, as the conclusion of the MCU's Multiverse Saga.
    <br>
    Ideas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003,[2] with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures.
    Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film.
    Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote The Incredible Hulk which introduced Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006 and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007.
    In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers.
    After the successful release of Iron Man (2008) in May which introduced Iron Man, the company set a July 2011 release date for The Avengers.
    In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.
